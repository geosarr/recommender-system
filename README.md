This is a project on a basic product recommender system. Two datasets are used: a fake one to illustrate the failure of a naive approach when dealing with a relatively large amount of data and another one taken from Kaggle (Put the link here).

This work is inspired by the practical session of Guillaume Lecu√© (https://lecueguillaume.github.io/2015/10/08/compressed_sensing_course/)
